  <h2>Inspire MPLS</h2>

  <p>Inspire MPLS is a location based social networking site. It was built with the purpose of bringing creatives together locally in Minneapolis through sharing what inspires them about their city.</p>

  <h2>How it works:</h2>
  <ul id="how">
    <li>You <a href="/submit">submit</a> an image of something that inspires you about Minneapolis <span id="example">(This could be anything &ndash; a museum, park, coffee shop, art gallery, artist, etc...)</span></li>
    <li>Tell them why it inspires you</li>
    <li>Browse what others are inspired by</li>
    <li>Network with local creatives! (there will be an <a href="/event">event</a> for this)</li>
  </ul>
